bettertext.css v0.1.0
=====================

Improved typography styles. Great for naked HTML (without any classnames) and Markdown-generated content.


## How to use

Insert bettertext.css after [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) and after your `@font-face` declaration.

Feel free to edit any rules as you need.
